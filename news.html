            <h2>Coffee Art Gets Competitive – First-ever International Grand Latte Art Championship creates forum for
              artistic baristas</h2>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
              Latte art lovers will have the chance to show off their most beautiful creations at the inaugural
              International Grand
              Latte Art Championship (IGLAC) on 7 August 2021 in Sydney. Created by specialty roaster Danes Specialty
              Coffee, the
              event boasts over $10,000 in prizes and is bound to take latte art to the next level by drawing the
              region’s top
              baristas. <br /><br />

              “The International Grand Latte Art Championship is a natural extension of the Danes Grand Barista
              Championship, which
              has welcomed over 1,000 competitors worldwide,” said Paul Jackson, Danes Specialty Coffee Managing
              Director.
              “This brand new event is an exciting creative forum for our world-class baristas, and is also a
              celebration of
              Australians’ endearment for milk-based coffees,” said Jackson.<br /><br />

              Riverina FreshTM will be supporting this exciting event as an official partner. Our award winning Full Fat
              2L is the
              preferred milk of choice for the event as it is easily textured – consistently delivering a silky canvas
              for perfectly
              glossy latte art presentation and an unmistakably rich mouth feel. <br /><br />

              SanRemo coffee machines, also an official partner, will generously supply several of its iconic Opera
              espresso machines
              to be set up in-house for the competition to be conducted on. The Opera is making headlines all over the
              world and is
              already becoming an iconic espresso machine with its patented brew design features. <br /><br />

              The IGLAC boasts an incredible prize pool to entice baristas to compete at their best – a cash prize of
              $3,000 for the
              winner, in addition to a full Specialty Coffee Association of America Level 1 and 2 training package.
              <br /><br />

              The action will coincide with the launch of Café pyd, part of The pyd Building, an award-winning,
              architecturally
              designed space in Sydney’s newest design and arts precinct, Waterloo. <br /><br />

            <h4>Format and Judging</h4>
            Fast, intense, fun, spectator-friendly and interactive, the IGLAC is open to all baristas. Three rounds of
            competition
            will kick off with a knockout round that sees competitors create one latte art creation from the
            “International Grand
            Latte Art Championship E-Wheel”. Winners from round one will proceed onto round two where the format sees
            each
            competitor create two coffees, one from the IGLAC E-Wheel and one signature latte art creation. The final
            round hosts
            the best and last four artists standing from the round two preliminary finals where each finalist will face
            off with
            their signature latte art creation.<br /><br />

            A coffee-celebrity-studded judging panel includes Jibbi Little, 2021 NSW Latte Art Champion, and Caleb
            ‘Tiger’ Cha, 2021
            World Latte Art Champion.<br /><br />

            <h2>Fair trade coffee</h2>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
              Fair trade coffee is coffee that is certified as having been produced to fair trade standards by fair
              trade
              organizations, which create trading partnerships that are based on dialogue, transparency and respect,
              with the goal of
              achieving greater equity in international trade. These partnerships contribute to sustainable development
              by offering
              better trading conditions to coffee bean farmers. Fair trade organizations support producers and
              sustainable
              environmental farming practices and prohibit child labor or physical forced labor. <br /><br />

            <h4>Fair trade organizations</h4>
            The fair trade labeling organizations having most of the market share and who sell through supermarkets
            refer to a
            definition developed by FINE, an association of four international fair trade networks (Fairtrade Labelling
            Organizations International, World Fair Trade Organization (WFTO), Network of European World shops and
            European Fair
            Trade Association (EFTA)). The standards developed by Fairtrade Labelling Organization are the most widely
            used.[4]
            Fairtrade Labelling Organization (FLO) International is the overall body that governs the fairtrade system.
            It aims to
            achieve high standards within the fairtrade system in terms of credibility, compliance of Fairtrade
            Standards by
            producers, traders, and retailers.

            <h4>FLO's Main Tasks</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Setting International Fairtrade Standards</li>
              <li>FLO provides independent, transparent and competent standard setting by proposing the Fairtrade
                Standards to the FLO
                Board that decides if standards are met.[5] Each producer or trader has to meet the Generic Standards
                and the Product
                Standards which guarantees minimum prices that are considered fair to producers. They also aim for long
                term trading
                relationships and environmental sustainability.</li>

              <li>Facilitating and Developing Fairtrade Business</li>
              <li>The FLO works with both Fairtrade Certified producer organizations and traders to match supply and
                demand. It is also
                responsible for strengthening these organizations and improve their access to the market.
                Making the case for Fairtrade Justice
                FLO together with other international Fair Trade organizations, IFAT, NEWS and EFTA respectively, have
                created a common
                Platform called FINE (standing for the initial letters of FLO, IFAT, NEWS and EFTA) to work together to
                promote the case
                for trade justice in debates on trade and development.</li>
